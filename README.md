# CAFA-5-protein-function-prediction
Submission to the CAFA 5 protein function prediction competition

Amino-acid sequences representing proteins are embedded using the ESM-2 protein embedding model. These embeddings are used as inputs to a neural network which aims to predict the functions belonging to each protein. These functions are represented by terms from the Gene Ontology, a directed acyclic graph which describes biological functions and their relationships.
